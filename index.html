                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To maximize your results over these 5 weeks, understanding and applying the principles of progressive overload is crucial. This means continually challenging your muscles so they adapt and grow stronger. Here’s how to approach it:</p>
                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">1. Tracking is Essential</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Keep a log (notebook or phone app) of the weights you lift and the reps you achieve for each exercise. This is how you'll track your progress and know when to increase the challenge.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">2. Reps in Reserve (RIR)</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">This helps gauge your effort:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 ml-4">
                            <li><strong>RIR 3-2:</strong> You could have done 2-3 more reps. (Good for learning form, early weeks).</li>
                            <li><strong>RIR 1-0:</strong> You could only do 0-1 more reps. (Pushing close to your limit, later weeks).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">3. Progressive Overload Methods</h2>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 ml-4 space-y-1">
                            <li><strong>Increase Weight:</strong> The primary method. If you hit the top end of your rep range easily, increase the weight by the smallest increment available (e.g., 1kg, 2.5kg, or one plate on a machine).</li>
                            <li><strong>Increase Reps:</strong> If you can't increase weight, try to get one or two more reps than last time within the target range.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decrease Rest Time:</strong> For accessory work, you can slightly shorten rest periods (e.g., from 60s to 45s) to increase intensity. (Use sparingly, prioritize form and recovery).</li>
                            <li><strong>Improve Form/Time Under Tension:</strong> Focus on slower, more controlled movements, especially the lowering (eccentric) phase of an exercise. Better form means better muscle activation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                     <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">Remember, consistency and proper form are paramount. Never sacrifice form for heavier weight or more reps.</p>

                <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-primary">Required Equipment</h1>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Before you begin this 5-week workout plan, please ensure your office gym or workout space has access to the following equipment. Having the right tools will help you perform the exercises correctly and safely.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Dumbbells:</strong> A good range of weights, ideally from 2.5kg up to at least 20-25kg (in 1kg, 2.5kg, or 5kg increments).</li>
                    <li><strong>Barbell & Weight Plates:</strong> An Olympic barbell with various weight plates (e.g., 2.5kg, 5kg, 10kg, 20kg).</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjustable Bench:</strong> A bench that can be set to flat, incline, and ideally decline positions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Squat Rack / Power Rack / Smith Machine:</strong> For safely performing barbell squats and presses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cable Machine / Functional Trainer:</strong> With various attachments (D-handle, rope, straight bar).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lat Pulldown Machine:</strong> For back exercises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seated Calf Raise Machine:</strong> Or a sturdy step/plate for standing calf raises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cardio Equipment:</strong> Treadmill, stationary bike, elliptical, or rower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mat:</strong> For core work and stretching.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sturdy Chair:</strong> For chair squats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Barbell Pad (Recommended):</strong> For comfort during Hip Thrusts.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p class="text-gray-700 mt-6">If your gym is missing a specific piece of equipment, check the exercise notes for potential alternatives or focus on performing the exercise with excellent form using what's available. Some exercises can be adapted (e.g., cable exercises with dumbbells).</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To get the most out of this 5-week plan and ensure you're supporting your body effectively, keep these crucial reminders in mind:</p>
                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Nutrition</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Prioritize protein intake (aim for 1.6–2.2g per kg of your body weight) to support muscle repair and growth. Fuel your body with whole, unprocessed foods. Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Sleep</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep is when your body recovers, repairs muscle tissue, and consolidates learning. It's crucial for performance and results.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Consistency</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">The key to seeing results is showing up and putting in the effort consistently. Stick to the schedule as much as possible. Even on days you don't feel 100%, a lighter workout or active recovery is often better than skipping entirely (unless you genuinely need rest).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Listen to Your Body</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">If you feel sharp pain during an exercise, stop immediately. Differentiate between muscle soreness (normal) and joint pain (a warning sign). If you're overly fatigued or feeling unwell, consider an extra rest day or slightly reducing the volume/intensity of your workout. It's a 5-week plan, but don't push through significant pain or illness, as this can lead to injury or burnout.</p>
                    </div>
                     <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">By paying attention to these areas alongside your training, you'll set yourself up for a successful and rewarding 5 weeks!</p>
